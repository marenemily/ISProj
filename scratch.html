    <h3>My Story</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>I have played the violin since I was 8 years old. I hated it for the longest time, but when I joined my middle school orchestra, I grew to love it!</li>
    <li>Although I loved it, I didn't see myself doing this for the rest of my life. So when I got to high school, I joined the program for one year to get my credit, and then planned to quit.</li>
    <li>When my orchestra director, Ms. Prontka, saw that I wasn't on her role for the next year, she pulled me into her office and asked me what was going on. I told her I wanted to quit. She said, "no, you're not going to quit." She then asked why, and I said I wanted a study hall, and she said, "no, that's just not good enough."</li>
    <li>I quickly folded and changed my schedule. Partially because I was terrified of this woman, but also because I knew she was right. I ended up staying in her program all four years of high school and it was the best part of my high school experience.</li>
    <li>Orchestra harbored my passion for music and no matter what else was happening in my life, I always knew I had my 55 minute class to take a break and just play my violin. It became my therapy. It also helped my leadership skills - learning how to lead my section and orchestra as first chair, managing the class as Vice President, etc. </li>
    <li>I am eternally grateful for Ms. Prontka, my violin, and music.</li>
    </ul>
